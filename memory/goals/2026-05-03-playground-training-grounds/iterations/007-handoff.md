## What changed this round

### Sidebar / workspace-shell

- HermesWorld is now a **promoted link directly under Search → New Session**.
- Duplicate nav entry removed from the MAIN section.
- Icon changed from shared Rocket to **gold Castle02** so it no longer looks like Conductor.
- Gold `NEW` badge retained.
- `/playground` now **auto-hides desktop sidebar** and also hides `ChatPanel` + `ChatPanelToggle`.
  - Reason: HermesWorld HUD uses many `position: fixed` overlays, and the sidebar/chat panel were visually overlapping the game surface.

### HermesWorld polish

- 3 new avatar presets: **Chronos / Artemis / Eros**.
- Cinematic camera mode: **Tab** cycles 6 filming angles.
- Camera preset toast added.
- Transition loading screen upgraded to gold HermesWorld lore card.
- ASCII trailer helper script added: `scripts/ascii-trailer.sh`.

## Current UX state

### Working well

- Multiplayer is working via HTTP polling fallback.
- Public hub is live and healthy.
- HermesWorld feels much more branded and demo-ready.
- Sidebar positioning issue should now be resolved because the sidebar is hidden on `/playground`.

### Likely next checks

1. **Hard refresh and visually verify** the sidebar changes:
   - Search
   - New Session
   - HermesWorld (NEW)
   - MAIN section below that
2. Verify the Castle icon reads well in both light and dark themes.
3. Verify opening `/playground` no longer shows the workspace sidebar or right-side chat panel.
4. Record a short pass to make sure the camera preset cycle feels good on video.

## Known issues / audit notes

### Not blocking ship

- `pnpm build` is clean.
- There are **pre-existing TypeScript errors** in the repo unrelated to this pass:
  - Cloudflare worker types missing (`DurableObjectNamespace`, `WebSocketPair`, etc.)
  - `three` declaration warnings in playground components
  - some older test/export/type drift elsewhere in the app
- These did **not** block build or runtime.

### Branch risk

- Branch is **117 commits ahead of `origin/main`**.
- This is **not just HermesWorld**. It includes earlier local-only work:
  - agent-view port work
  - dashboard tweaks
  - theme rename / polish
  - agora/community related changes
- Do **not** casually push this branch straight to main without deciding whether to:
  1. ship the whole integration branch, or
  2. cherry-pick only HermesWorld commits to a clean branch.

Recommendation from this session: **probably ship the integration branch intentionally**, but pause long enough to review the non-playground commits list before PR.

## Immediate next tasks

### If continuing product polish

- Evaluate whether HermesWorld needs a small **"Back to Workspace"** button since the sidebar is now hidden on the route.
- Possibly replace the plain Castle icon with a **custom tiny HermesWorld lockup/icon** if Eric wants something more branded than a stock icon.
- Tune the top title/page title from `Playground` to `HermesWorld` anywhere still visible in browser/UI.
- Check if any remaining copy still says **Playground** instead of HermesWorld.

### If preparing to ship

- Record demo first.
- Decide PR strategy:
  - integration PR from current branch, or
  - clean HermesWorld-only branch via cherry-pick.
- Draft PR body around:
  - multiplayer 3D RPG onboarding
  - 6 worlds / 6 skills
  - Cloudflare hub
  - avatar customizer / cinematic camera / title branding

## Suggested opening move next session

1. Hard refresh.
2. Open `/playground` and confirm sidebar/chat overlap is truly gone.
3. Confirm the promoted HermesWorld link looks right in the left nav.
4. If clean, move directly into **recording + PR strategy**.

This session ended after writing the handoff, with the branch clean and build passing.
