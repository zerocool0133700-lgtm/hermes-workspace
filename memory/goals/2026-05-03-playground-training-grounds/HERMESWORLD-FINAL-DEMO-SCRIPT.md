## Pre-record (5 min)

1. Hard refresh both tabs (`Cmd+Shift+R`) so the latest bundle loads.
2. Window 1280×720 or 1920×1080 — close DevTools.
3. System notifications muted, Do Not Disturb on.
4. Reset progress (DevTools → Application → Local Storage → delete `playerProfile`, then refresh) for a fresh tutorial run.
5. Open Map screen once before recording to warm the assets.
6. Mute toggle should be **OFF** — narration auto-plays per world.
7. Verify multiplayer hub:
   ```bash
   curl https://hermes-playground-ws.myaurora-agi.workers.dev/health
   # {"ok":true,"online":N,"ts":...}
   ```

## Talking points for voice-over (replace the auto-narration if recording your own)

1. **Title screen**: "Hermes Workspace turns agent onboarding into a multiplayer RPG. This is **HermesWorld** — a 3D realm where you don't read about Hermes, you play it."
2. **Training Grounds**: "Six worlds. Each one teaches a real Hermes Agent skill. Movement, equipment, chat, memory, summoning, diplomacy."
3. **Combat**: "Engineering: detect the issue, choose the right tool, clear the blocker. The Glitch Wisp is a stand-in for every flaky API or noisy prompt."
4. **Familiar**: "Summoning: spawn sub-agents on demand to extend your reach without bloating your context. This familiar represents that pattern."
5. **Knight gear**: "Your gear maps to your Hermes loadout. Each piece changes both your stats and your silhouette in the world."
6. **Multiplayer**: "Real multiplayer over Cloudflare Durable Objects. Other Hermes builders walking the same Agora as you. Chat, presence, world-scoped fan-out."
7. **End**: "HermesWorld. The fastest way to teach builders what Hermes Agent actually feels like."

## Multiplayer test plan (re-verify before recording)

1. Open tab A: http://localhost:3005/playground (or 3006).
2. Open tab B: http://localhost:3006/playground (different origin = clean isolation).
3. Walk both into Training Grounds.
4. Chat header chip in both tabs: **green dot · 2 players · live**.
5. Type "hi" in tab A → bubble over your head in A, message in chat panel A, bubble over the same player in B's view, message in chat panel B.
6. Background tab A for 60 seconds. Tab B's view of A should persist.
7. Close tab A entirely. Tab B should remove the avatar within ~1s (sendBeacon leave).
