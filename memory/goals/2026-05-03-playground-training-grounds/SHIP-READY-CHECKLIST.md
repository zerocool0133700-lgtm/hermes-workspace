# Hermes Playground — ship-ready checklist + multiplayer test plan

Status: **branch local-only on `feat/agent-view-port-from-clawsuite`** (do not push without Eric approval).
Latest commit: `13bc6e234`.

## 1. How to test multiplayer (5 min)

### Same-machine (fast smoke test)

1. Hard refresh the playground in your current browser tab: **Cmd+Shift+R**.
2. Open a second tab → http://localhost:3005/playground
3. Both tabs should:
   - Show each other's nameplates walking around
   - See the **online count chip** in the HUD increment to 2
   - Receive each other's chat messages (press `Enter` in chat)
4. Same-browser presence runs over BroadcastChannel + WS, so this works even with no network.

### Cross-device (real multiplayer)

1. Phone or second machine on **any network** (LAN or cellular).
2. From your dev Mac, expose 3005 — **easiest options**:
   - `tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:3005` → use the printed `https://aurora.tail***.ts.net` URL.
   - Or just use the public WS hub directly: anyone running their own copy of Playground will already meet you in the same shared world (the WS hub is global, the dev server is local-only).
3. With the `.env` we just wrote, both clients connect to:
   `wss://hermes-playground-ws.myaurora-agi.workers.dev/playground`
4. Verify in the browser console: you should see one WebSocket connection to that URL and **no fallback to BroadcastChannel-only** (transport indicator shows "ws" or "both").

### Verify hub health from CLI

```bash
curl https://hermes-playground-ws.myaurora-agi.workers.dev/health
# → {"ok":true,"online":N,"ts":...}

curl https://hermes-playground-ws.myaurora-agi.workers.dev/stats
# → {"online":N,"byWorld":{...},"peakToday":N,"peakDay":"..."}
```

## 3. Pre-record checklist

- [ ] Cmd+Shift+R the playground tab to load latest build.
- [ ] Window 1280×720 (or 1920×1080) — close DevTools.
- [ ] System notifications muted, Do Not Disturb on.
- [ ] In-game audio toggle ON (the synth ambient is genuinely good).
- [ ] Reset progress for a clean tutorial run (DevTools → Application → Local Storage → delete `playerProfile`, then refresh).
- [ ] Open the Map screen once before recording so assets are warm.
- [ ] Test mouse pan: left-click drag rotates, wheel zooms — both should feel snappy.
- [ ] Open a 2nd tab to confirm online count chip lights up.

## 4. Showcase flow (mirrors `iterations/006-showcase.md`)

| #         | Beat                                                                                 | Time     |

## 5. Known limitations to call out (or hide)

- Branch is **not pushed** — anyone cloning the repo today won't see iterations 003–006 yet.
- Forge/Grove/Oracle interiors are functional but less dense than Training/Agora.
- Ground textures are flat color — fine for video, slightly thin in still screenshots.
- WS hub free tier on Cloudflare Workers — fine for hackathon traffic, not battle-tested at scale.
- LLM dialog requires `VITE_PLAYGROUND_LLM_CHAT=1` — default is offline-first scripted dialog (intentional).

## 6. If something breaks during recording

| Symptom                        | Fix                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Camera frozen / left-drag dead | Cmd+Shift+R; check console for WS errors; mouse-look effect is in `playground-world-3d.tsx` ~L939                      |
| Multiplayer nameplate missing  | Check Network tab for `wss://hermes-playground-ws.*/playground`; `.env` must be loaded by Vite (restart dev if needed) |
| Audio dead                     | Click anywhere first (browsers gate audio behind user gesture); check mute toggle in utility dock                      |
| Quest stuck                    | Try `localStorage.removeItem('playerProfile'); location.reload()`                                                      |
| WS hub down                    | Falls back to BroadcastChannel — same-browser MP still works                                                           |
| Forge Gate locked              | Finish all 5 tutorial steps; `playerProfile.questProgress` flags it                                                    |

## 7. Push readiness

When Eric explicitly OKs a push:

```bash
cd /Users/aurora/.worktrees/hermes-playground-local
git log --oneline feat/agent-view-port-from-controlsuite ^origin/main
# Expect: ~6 commits including 0134c1b13, e2ff6bb05, c9268f77a, 94f861f6b, 13bc6e234

git push origin feat/agent-view-port-from-controlsuite
gh pr create --title "Hermes Playground: Training Grounds + multiplayer" \
             --body "$(cat memory/goals/2026-05-03-playground-training-grounds/iterations/006-showcase.md)"
```

Branch must NOT be pushed without explicit Eric approval.
