  - approval banner wiring is fixed so tool approvals are visible again
  - local-only portable sessions can be deleted correctly
  - dashboard fallback added for session create/update/fork flows

## Suggested short release description

Claude-Workspace 2.1.0 ships Swarm: a built-in multi-agent control surface for persistent worker agents, orchestrator-first routing, Board + reports + inbox flows, and a set of reliability fixes across chat streaming, approvals, sessions, and Claude path handling.

## Suggested launch post

Claude-Workspace 2.1.0 is out.

It ships **Swarm**: a built-in multi-agent workspace where one ClaudeAgent can orchestrate persistent worker agents with live checkpoints, Board, inbox/review flow, and better routing between orchestrator and workers.

Also in 2.1.0:

- stronger long-run SSE chat reliability
- approval banner fix
- portable session deletion fix
- dashboard fallback for session actions
- Claude path handling improvements

If you want multi-agent control without leaving your workspace, this is the release.
